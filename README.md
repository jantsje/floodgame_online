## Installation
To install the app to your local oTree directory, copy the folder 'floodgame_online' to your oTree Django project and extent the session configurations in your settings.py at the root of the oTree directory:

```
SESSION_CONFIGS = [
    dict(
        name='floodgame_online',
        display_name="Floodgame online",
        num_demo_participants=1,
        app_sequence=['floodgame_online'],
        quota_discount=1,
        quota_baseline=1,
        quota_voluntary=1,
        quota_voluntary_discount=1,
        quota_no_insurance=1,
        language='nl'
    )
```

Understanding questions rely on [otree-utils](https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/otreeutils) and are different for each treatment.

## Treatments
* no insurance (mandatory no insurance)
* baseline (mandatory insurance)
* discount (mandatory insurance, discount offered on premium when pp invested in damage-reducing measures)
* voluntary (includes WTP pages, pp with WTP > subsidized premium are insured in the game)
* voluntary discount (includes WTP pages, pp with WTP > subsidized premium are insured in the game, discount offered)

## Target group
Note that the first page ('Welkom') asks for homeownership and postal code. The 'postcodes.py' file is used as input to determine whether a respondent is in the target area. 
Respondents who answer that they do not own their home or those who enter a postcode that is not in 'postcodes.py' will be redirected to the no-target-group-message of the panel company. 

## Instructions pop-up
Instructions are available in a pop-up screen (modal) throughout the game. JavaScript code tracks how often respondents click this button ('opened_instructions').
